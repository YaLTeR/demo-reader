# GTK + Rust + Meson + Flatpak = <3

A boilerplate template to get started with GTK, Rust, Meson, Flatpak made for GNOME. It can be adapted for other desktop environments like elementary.

<div align="center">
![Main Window](data/resources/screenshots/screenshot1.png "Main Window")
</div>

### What does it contains?

- A simple window with a headerbar
- Bunch of useful files that you SHOULD ship with your application on Linux:
    - Metainfo: describe your application for the different application stores out there;
    - Desktop: the application launcher;
    - Icons: This repo contains three icons, a normal, a nightly & monochromatic icon (symbolic) per the GNOME HIG, exported using [App Icon Preview](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.design.AppIconPreview).
- Flatpak Manifest for nightly builds
- Dual installation support
- Uses Meson for building the application
- Bundles the UI files & the CSS using gresources
- A pre-commit hook to run rustfmt on your code
- Tests to validate your Metainfo, Schemas & Desktop files
- Gsettings to store the window state, more settings could be added
- Gitlab CI to produce flatpak nightlies
- i18n support

### How to init a project ?

The template ships a simple python script to init a project easily. It asks you a few questions and replaces & renames all the necessary files.

The script requires having `git` installed on your system.

You can run it with,
```
python3 create-project.py
```

```
âžœ python3 create-project.py
